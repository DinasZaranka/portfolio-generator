# Portfolio generator 
Team project, made by Dinas Zaranka and Emilijus Trinkūnas for our Procedural Programming assignment

To generate your portfolio:
1. Add your own "pfp.jpg" file in the assets folder(if none is provided a default profile picture will be given)
2. Run the generator.exe file and follow the instructions
The program will generate a file named "index.html" which will include your template
To ensure the program works correctly:
- index.html has to be in the parent folder
- template.html, style.css and your pfp.jpg have to be inside the assets folder
